 --> wiki style flavor without the bad wiki aftertaste <--


Abstract::
----------

 wicked is a framework addition to allow developers to add wiki-ish
 behavior to content objects via getters and setters to a content
 display area.


Premise::
---------

 Wiki does two things really well: convenient document creation,
 immediate interlinking of documents.  To leverage these features,
 wiki's have a nasty tendency to aggregate random other features in a
 haphazard way.

 wicked reduces 'wiki' to a feature of content by stripping away
 everything except for for creating, tracking, and managing wiki links
 within a CMF site.  wicked will yield all other feature unto the CMS


Goals::
-------

 - Easy link based creation of content

 - Easy intuitive linking of content by explicit wiki links

 - Reference system for relating interlinked content
