--> wiki style flavor without the bad wiki aftertaste <--



Abstract::
----------

wicked is a framework addition to Archetype to allow developers to add wiki-ish behavior to AT content objects via a schema field. 



Premise::
---------

 Wiki does two things really well: convenient document creation, immediate interlinking of documents.  To leverage these features, wiki's have a nasty tendency to aggregate random other features.


 wicked will attempt to reduce 'wiki' to a feature of content rather by stripping away everything except for providing a framework for creating wiki links within a CMF site.  wicked will yield all other feature unto the CMS




Goals::
-------


o Easy link based creation of content

o Easy intuitive linking of content by wiki links

o Reference system for relating interlinked content



HowTo::
-------


Directions for use coming soon
